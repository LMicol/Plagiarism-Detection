# Plagiarism-Detection
Second project from Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

## About this repository
This repository is the resolution of the second project of the udacity machine learning program. The objective of this project was to create and train a machine learning method to detect plagiarism. This project contains three resolution files, the main ones being the [2_Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering](https://github.com/LMicol/Plagiarism-Detection/blob/master/2_Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering.ipynb) and [3_Training_a_Model](https://github.com/LMicol/Plagiarism-Detection/blob/master/3_Training_a_Model.ipynb). The idea here was to use the [LCS algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) for plagiarism analysis. And from the results obtained, create an ML model that was capable of classifying a text as plagiarism or not.

Feel free to view my complete resolution, you just have to follow the ipynb files.
